# cluster-data-set Python
Dataset: The data set is 2d data (for ease of visualization) simulated from 3 Gaussians, with 
considerable overlap. There are 500 points from each Gaussian, ordered together in the file. The 
dataset is posted on D2L with this assignment. 

K-Means 
Implement the standard version of the K-Means algorithm. The initial 
starting points for the K cluster means can be K randomly selected data points. You should have an 
option to run the algorithm r times from r different randomly chosen initializations (e.g., r = 10), 
where you then select the solution that gives the lowest sum of squares error over the r runs. Run 
the algorithm for several different values of K and report the sum of squares error for each of these 
models.
